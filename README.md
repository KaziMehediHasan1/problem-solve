## 🐍 **Python DSA & Programming: Comprehensive Skill Validation (230+ Problems)**

### 🎖️ **Project Thesis: Mastery Through Volume and Diversity**

This repository documents an intensive, self-imposed challenge covering a comprehensive set of **230+ Python programming examples** sourced from GeeksforGeeks. This project is not merely about counting problems; it is a structured, end-to-end validation of my core expertise across fundamental Python concepts, essential Data Structures, complex Algorithms, and practical application areas like File Handling and Regex.

The primary goal is to demonstrate **mastery** in implementing highly optimized, robust, and production-ready Python solutions across the entire technical domain.

### 💡 **Code Quality and Optimization Philosophy**

Every solution is written with the following senior-level principles in mind:

1.  **Complexity Analysis:** Each file includes comments detailing the achieved **Time Complexity ($O(T)$)** and **Space Complexity ($O(S)$)**.
2.  **Type Hinting:** Extensive use of Python's `typing` module (`List[int]`, `Dict`, etc.) to enhance code clarity and maintainability for team collaboration.
3.  **Idiosyncratic Python:** Preference for Pythonic built-in functions and libraries (e.g., `enumerate`, `zip`, `collections.Counter`) over verbose manual implementation when optimization is maintained.
4.  **Testing Focus:** Solutions are built to pass GeeksforGeeks/LeetCode style test cases, focusing on edge cases inherent to the problem constraints.
